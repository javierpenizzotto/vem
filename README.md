# Vehicle Environment Monitor (VEM)

I created this project to remotely monitor temperature in my car when I bring
my dog on a trip and have to leave him tempororaly in the car. This gives me
a piece of mind knowing that the temperature is good for him to comfortably 
stay in the car.

**NOTE** [Here][1] cites the laws in different states that prohibits leaving
animal in motor vehicle in cirtain situations.
